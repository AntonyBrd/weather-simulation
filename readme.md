This small project introduce two solutions to generate fake weather data. 
The weather data is generated for the following cities:
- Sydney
- Darwin
- Paris
- Toulouse
- ...

The reader is invited to check each solution in their specific folder:
- Solution 1 : Gaussian randomness and business rules
- Solution 2 : Create a Neural Network that is able to produce fake data

Of course, the best way to answer the problem would be a combination of the two solutions.
