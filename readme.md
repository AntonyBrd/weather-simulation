# Simulate Weather with Python

This small project introduce a way to generate fake weather data with a very small code base. 
The weather data is generated for the following cities:
- Sydney
- Perth
- Melbourne
- Adelaide
- Darwin
- Ockland

## How to perform the simulation

### Pre requirements
- Python 2.7
- install pip
- run the following command
```bash
pip intall -r requirement.txt
```

Generating data files is as simple as running the command :
```
python GenerateWeather.py
```


## The approach

### Step 1: Defining different climate types
 
### Step 2: Create a list of city and get their climate

2.a Create a json file with city name and country

2.b Attribute a climate to each city <br>
_NB: We could make this step automatic by crawling into the Wikipedia page of the concerned City. 
There is a [Wikipedia Python package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wikipedia) that could help to do so._ 

### Step 3: Use an API to get City position



### Step 4:


## How to improve it
